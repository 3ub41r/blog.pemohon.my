In this very challenging competitive age, knowledge has become a commodity. Higher education institutions play a crucial role in servicing this need. The market has become very competitive with the influx of public and private institutions all competing to provide better quality education and services to the ever demanding market.

Malaysia is fast becoming the [choice of destination](https://www.nst.com.my/news/2017/03/138781/promoting-malaysia-regions-education-hub-choice) for foreign students from India, China and Islamic countries in particular to study in the fields of business, hospitality and tourism, culinary arts, computing and engineering.

Technology is now an integral part of our daily lives. However there are still many higher education institutions lagging behind in leveraging technology to reach out to their prospective students.

Here are a few of the issues higher education institutions face in the recruitment process which we feel could be solved by proper use of technology.

### Tedious application process

Some institutions still use physical application forms, usually in the form of PDF files (or some other document formats). Applicants are required to download the form from their website, print it out, fill it up and physically submit it via mail along with all the supporting documents. This process is **error prone** and **time consuming**.

### Application abandonment

Just like [online shopping carts](https://www.shopify.com/blog/8484093-why-online-retailers-are-losing-67-45-of-sales-and-what-to-do-about-it), applications are also frequently abandoned. There may be a variety of reasons for why applications are abandoned. Keeping an open line of communication and constantly engaging with applicants may help in indentifying these reasons. This allows the organization to make better decisions in an effort to reduce the rate of abandonment.

### Applicant engagement

In this age of the internet, we are bombarded with so much information that it is getting harder now for us to keep ourselves engaged and focused.

Oftentimes, applicants are not kept informed of the status of their application as it moves through the recruitment process leaving applicants bewildered. This will increase the chance of applicants abandoning their application and looking for other alternatives (your *competitors*). Keeping applicants engaged will also build relationships. 

### Inefficient use of resources

Costly man hours are spent on manual tasks, sifting through paperwork and contacting individual applicants. Coordinating such ativities across different departments is also a challenge.

An applicant may be contacted by several different people from the same organization on a single matter. Not only is this inefficient but it may also result in the organization being perceived as uncoordinated or even dysfunctional.

### Conclusion

The race for providing better quality education and services is getting more competitive by the day. Higher education institutions need to *up their game* in order to compete in today's ever changing world. Leveraging technology to optimize and improve the recruitment process could be a a big stepping stone towards providing high quality education and better learning experience for students.

Let's all make this world a better place to live in.
